This project presents an AI-based Aircraft Recognition System capable of detecting aircraft in images, videos, and real-time camera feeds and identifying their type automatically.

The system uses:

YOLOv8 for aircraft detection

ResNet-50 (CNN with Transfer Learning) for aircraft classification

The detection model locates aircraft using bounding boxes, and the classification model identifies the aircraft type with confidence scores.

This system can be applied in:

Airport surveillance

Airspace monitoring

Defense and security systems

UAV and drone tracking

Aviation research and analytics

🚀 Features

✔ Aircraft detection using YOLOv8
✔ Aircraft classification using ResNet-50
✔ Image input support
✔ Video input support
✔ Real-time webcam detection
✔ Web-based interface using Flask
✔ Modular architecture (detection + classification pipeline)
